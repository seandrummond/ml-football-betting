This repository details the methods used to develop a quantitative strategy to bet on markets in professional football (soccer) matches. The strategy has three unique characteristics; feature extraction, use of look-up-tables for confident bet selection, and a statistical method to maximize return. Machine Learning algorithms, probabilistic & statistical methods and football knowledge were all used to develop this strategy.

This repository contains the code, instructions and a brief paper on the results.
